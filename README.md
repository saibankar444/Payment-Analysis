## 📊 SQL Analysis Summary

All SQL queries were performed using [DB Fiddle](https://www.db-fiddle.com/).  
The schema and insert statements are available in `queries.sql`.

| Metric                  | Value             |
|-------------------------|------------------|
| ✅ Total Transactions    | 200               |
| 💰 Total Success Amount  | ₹3,62,378.30      |
| ❌ Failed Transactions   | 49                |
| 🏦 Top Payment Method    | UPI               |
| 📉 Highest Failure Rate  | Wallet            |
| 🕒 Peak Failure Hours    | 3PM & 9PM         |
| 🏆 Top Transaction       | ₹4,949 via Card   |

## 💡 Recommendations

Based on the analysis:
- Implement retry logic for **Wallet** payments (highest failure rate)
- Set **UPI** as default method (highest revenue contributor)
- Apply **gateway switching** or backups during peak failure hours (15:00 & 21:00)
- Monitor top customers (high-value payments) for special care
